# State Pattern 
I chose State design Pattern as this game is based on states.
I created separate states for ChoosingActor, CPUMoving, SelectingMenuItem, SelectingNewLocation, SelectingTarget and StateOperator. State pattern allows me to divide into different states which is beneficial for easier access later on to make changes.An object's behaviour is shown as a result of the state's functionality, which is modified and changed dependent on the state. This allowed me to remove switch cases as it was dependent on it.
State Pattern allows easier addition of states which gives additional support to the object's behaviour.
